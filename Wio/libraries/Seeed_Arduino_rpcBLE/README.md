Seeed Arduino rpcBLE software library calls Seeed Arduino rpcUnified to implement BLE function compatibility with Arduino-ESP32. To reduce the cost of using the software, you can import your favorite ESP32 ble app directly, with minor changes, and then use it. You'll find that your favorite ESP32 app has BLE5.0 features, runs on ARM and other architectures.  Hope you like this software and let us know if you have any feedback.

### **Feature**

- Maximum Compatible with ESP32 BLE library
- Powered by Realtek RTL8720DN
- BLE / BLE 5.0
- low power consumption
